    <p>We share your personal data within Our company. This may involve in some cases transferring your data outside the

    <p>Some of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will

            Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland, Uruguay and UK).
        </li>
        <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission
            which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
        </li>
        <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield
            which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US, or we
            may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection
            it has in Europe, with standard contractual clauses. Please contact us if you want further information on
            the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
        </li>
    </ul>

        data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will
        only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>

    <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
        applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

    <h2>9. Data retention</h2>

    <p>How long will you use my personal data for?</p>

    <p>We will keep your Personal Information while you have an account with us. Thereafter, we will keep your Personal
        Information for as long as is necessary to respond to any questions, complaints or claims made by you or on your
        behalf, to show that we treated you fairly, and to keep records required by law.</p>

    <p>We will not retain your Personal Information for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this policy.
        When it is no longer necessary to retain your Personal Information we will securely destroy it in accordance
        with applicable laws and regulations. In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can
        no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this
        information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

    <p>Please see <b>Table 2</b> at the foot of this notice to view details of retention periods for different aspects
        of your personal data.</p>

    <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see ‘Request Erasure’ in Section 10 Your legal rights
        for further information.</p>

    <p>In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for
        research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice
        to you.</p>

    <h2>10. Your legal rights</h2>

    <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:</p>

    <p>Request access to your personal data – (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to
        receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>

    <p>Request correction of your personal data – This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold
        about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>

    <ul class="list-style">
        <li>Request erasure of your personal data – (commonly known as the “right to be forgotten”). This enables you to
            ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You
            also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised
            your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or
            where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not
            always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to
            you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
        </li>
        <li>Object to processing of your personal data – where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
            third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
            processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the
            right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we
            may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
            rights and freedoms.
        </li>
        <li>Request restriction of processing your personal data – This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing
            of your personal data in the following scenarios:
        </li>
        <ul class="pl-4">
            <li>(a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;</li>
            <li>(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
            <li>(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
                exercise or defend legal claims; or
            </li>
            <li>(d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
                legitimate grounds to use it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Request transfer of your personal data – (also known as the “right to data portability”) We will provide to
            you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
            format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for
            us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
        </li>
        <li>Right to withdraw consent – However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out
            before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain
            products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our Data Protection Compliance Manager,
        in writing with full details of your request by emailing directly on:</p>

    <p>Data Protection Compliance contact.at.theapplygroup.com</p>

    <p>No fee usually required.</p>

    <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we
        may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may
        refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

    <h2>What we may need from you</h2>

    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
        access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that
        personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you
        for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
