                        <h2>Study Medicine at The University of Glasgow</h2>
                        <p>Glasgow offers a five-year medical course with a spiral curriculumthat incorporateslectures,
                            problem-based learning and small-group teaching as well as clinical placementsacross West
                            Scotland. The course is divided into four phases.</p>
                        <p>Phase one,which takes place during the first half of first year,involves learning
                            theprinciples of biomedical science, developing basic clinical skills and clinical
                            learningthrough visits to the A&E and GPs.</p>
                        <p>During Phase two,which lasts for the remainder of first year and entire secondyear,students
                            cover modules in anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology amongothers through a
                            systems-based approach. Vocational and professional studies also takeplace during the first
                            two phases as well as development of clinical and communicationskills.</p>
                        <p>In Phase three, during the first half of third year, students explore the body systemsfrom a
                            pathophysiological point of view through small-group case-based teaching sessionswith
                            clinical tutors. Clinical skills are also expanded further to includevital procedural skills
                            in preparation for Phase four.</p>
                        <p>Phase four lasts from the second half of the third year until midway through fifth year.The
                            majority of clinical education principally takes place during this phase throughplacements
                            at hospitals, GPs and other clinical settings. Students expand theirclinical knowledge
                            through a number of specialist placements in disciplines such asPaediatrics, Obstetrics and
                            Gynaecology, Psychiatry, etc.</p>
                        <p>The final stage of the medical course involves Preparation for Practice (PfP) in
                            whichstudents undertake a Foundation doctor shadowing programme along with lectures as
                            partof their final training for their future role as a junior doctor.</p>
                        <p>Students will also have the chance to undertake Student-Selected Components (SSCs) toallows
                            them to study in any field of interest. Uniquely, Glasgow also offers twoelective periods
                            during the summer of the third and fourth years in any specialty ofinterest to the student.
