                        <h2>Study Medicine at Lancaster University</h2>
                        <p>The five-yearmedical course offered by Lancaster involves teaching delivered through a range
                            of lectures, clinical anatomy teaching and small-group problem-based learning(PBL)
                            activities. Students also get early exposure to the clinical environment fromthe start of
                            the course.</p>
                        <p>In the first year, teaching is predominantly within the university campus and includes
                            learning the fundamentals of biomedical and social science through a problem-based learning
                            approach. Student also develop some basic clinical and communication skills.Inthe second
                            year, students divide their time between the university campus and hospital placements as
                            part of their integrated medical teaching and training.</p>
                        <p>In the third year, students expand clinical education through rotations that incorporate
                            lectures and tutorials with clinical teaching, patient interaction and small-group PBL
                            activities. Skills in communication are also further enhanced from this year onwards. In the
                            fourth year, clinical experience is broaden through further placements in a variety of
                            different healthcare environments including hospitals and community settings. And in the
                            final year, extensive clinicaltraining takes place in preparation for becoming a junior
                            doctor. This includes further development of procedural and examination skills.</p>
                        <p>Lancaster also offerSelectives in Advanced Medical Practice to allow students opportunities
                            for exploration into fields of interest in greater study. An elective period also takes
                            place to allow study abroad in any specialty of interest. Student may also choose to spend a
                            year between the fourth and fifth year studying within a medical-related field to obtain a
                            BSc, MSc or MPhil (i.e. intercalation).</p>
