                            an understand of each system in health and illness and delves into aspects of both

                            in patient examination and history-taking as well as communication and diagnostic reasoning
                            through classroomlearning and placements in a range of healthcare settings.</p>
                        <p>In the third year, clinical attachments take place across different specialties in the
                            medical and surgical field and involves teaching in social science, public health and

                        <p>The final year focuses on further increasing clinical experience in medical students and
                            preparation for the Foundation programme. Teaching will involve collaborating within a
                            clinical team to work on a wide range of cases. Throughout this year, skillsin patient
                            investigation, diagnosis and treatment are further developed in different areas of
                            medicine.BSMS also offer an optional year to undertake an intercalated degree between the
