                                <h2>Study Medicine at The University of Limerick</h2>
                                <p> The University of Limerick (UL) offers a four-year integrated medicine course for
                                    post-graduate students. The medical programme focuses on teaching students to not
                                    only become knowledgeable clinicians, but rather to go beyond that and shape
                                    students into intelligent, empathetic doctors who will go on to practice
                                    patient-centred, evidence-based medicine. </p>
                                <p> Teaching at UL takes on a problem-based learning(PBL) approach and incorporates
                                    lectures, tutorials, workshops and seminars. Additionally, the small-group teaching
                                    activities during course enhance knowledge and understanding as well as
                                    communication and teamwork skills. UL also engages students in modern multi-faceted
                                    approaches for anatomy teaching that utilised advanced technological facilities.
                                </p>
                                <p> The three core themes and domains that are focused on during the course are:
                                    Knowledge of Health and Illness, Clinical and Anatomical Skills and Professional
                                    Competencies. Students gain early exposure to the clinical environment and patient
                                    contact and are taught from the beginning of the course about how to reflect and
                                    improve upon experiences. Clinical placements take place across six different
                                    medicine teaching hospitals (that focus on different medical and surgical
                                    specialties) as well as a range of primary care settings. </p>
                                <p> Students at UL can also undertake Special Study Modules (electives) in the second,
                                    third and fourth years that allow exploration into areas of interest â€“ these
                                    electives may be done abroad. </p>
