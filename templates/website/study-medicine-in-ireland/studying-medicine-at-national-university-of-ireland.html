                                <h2>Study Medicine at National University of Ireland (NUI)</h2>
                                <p>The medical programme at NUI is a five/six-year course that aims to shape students
                                    into professional and intelligent doctors with highly developed skills in
                                    communication, teamwork, compassion and safe, ethical medical practice.</p>
                                <p>The medical education provided at NUI takes on a systems-based approach to teaching
                                    within their modern, integrated curriculum. Early on, students are taught the
                                    fundamental biomedical science underlying medicine and learn about the body in
                                    health, mechanismsof disease as well as the treatments for such clinical conditions.
                                    In the latter years of the course, students develop advanced clinical skills and
                                    massively expand their clinical knowledge and experience. clinical placements during
                                    the course take place at hospitals such as Mayo University Hospital, Letterkenny
                                    University Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital or Sligo University Hospital, in addition
                                    to a range of GPs and primaryhealthcare environments.</p>
                                <p>NUI offer a special study programme to allow students to explore their fascinations
                                    and interests within the medical field. A chance to participate in a summer research
                                    programme alongside a senior researcher is also given to students â€“ this providesan
                                    opportunity to develop research skills and to get a taste of what a career in
                                    medical/clinical research is like. In the final year of the programme, students
                                    prepare for their future role as a doctor througha transitioning programme and a
                                    junior internship to allow them to start becoming familiar with their specific roles
                                    and responsibilities.</p>
