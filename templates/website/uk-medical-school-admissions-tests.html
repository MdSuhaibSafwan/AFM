                            If your school/college is a registered test centre for the BMAT you can take this test
                            at your school or you will have to take it at another registered test centre.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is important to check on the website of the BMAT medical schools which BMAT test
                            sessions they accept since there are multiple sessions that take place in the year and
                            some universities are particular about which session
                            they accept.</p>
                        <p>
                            Again, it is important that you get plenty of practise well in advance of the test
                            session. This can be done by using preparation books, looking at online practise
                            questions and practising writing BMAT essays under timed conditions so that you know
                            what
                            to expect.

                        <p>
                            It is important to research which admissions test the university you’re applying to
                            requires as well as the average scores they look for of their applicants. This is
                            something that you will be able to ask from our Alumni at the medical schools you are
                            thinking of applying to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This will give you an idea of what kind of score you might aim to achieve in your
                            admissions tests or to help you decide which medical schools would be best to apply to
                            with the score you obtain.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Work experience for medical school application</h5>
                        <p>
                            Many medical schools look for their applicants to have some work experience (or
                            shadowing experience) in a healthcare environment. One of the reasons for this is that
                            it shows to the medical schools Admissions that you’ve taken the time to see what a
                            job in healthcare is like and what the role involves. It shows them that you have an
                            understanding of the career path that you’re choosing to enter. The last thing that
                            medical schools want is to accept a student into the
                            course who will later realise that medicine isn’t quite what they expected and drop out
                            of the degree as a result.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This experience will also benefit you and help you to decide whether becoming a doctor
                            really is what you want to do. Not tv shows, nor documentaries, nor books, nor articles
                            compare to spending some time in a healthcare environment to get a feeling of
                            what your future as a clinician may be like and whether this is a setting that you can
                            see yourself working in at the end of your degree.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However work experience may not always be easy to obtain, especially for a
                            16/17–year–old since GPs and hospitals may find it difficult to manage having students
                            and exposing them to patients due to confidentiality reasons. However there are other
                            forms
                            of experience such as volunteering or you may be able to search online for opportunities
                            designed for prospective medical applicants to gain this type of experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, what you want to be able to show is that you actively made an effort to find
                            any type of experience that you could because you are serious about becoming a
                            healthcare professional and getting into medical school. One way to seek advice about
                            obtaining work experience is by contacting one of our Alumni and, having gone through
                            the process themselves, they will be able to guide you in the right direction.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Writing a personal statement for medical school admission</h5>
                        <p>
                            Writing a personal statement is one of the key parts of the application process for UK
                            medical schools. This is the part of your application where you get to speak directly to
                            medical schools about why they should accept you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In your personal statement you need to explain why you are applying to study medicine,
                            what your aspirations are, what work experience you have and what fascinates you in the
                            medical field, etc. Here you should also write about what significant (and relevant)
                            achievements you have, projects you’ve done and societies or volunteering you have been
                            involved in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It takes a lot of thought and time to write a good personal statement that is not only
                            unique but one that also truly demonstrates who you are. There is a lot of guidance that
                            can be found online and in books about how to write a personal statement –
                            they provide advice about structure, length, tone, etc. But you want your statement to
                            really capture the attention of the Admissions people. The best way to do this is to
                            write a personal statement that describes the most
                            important aspects of who you are (from your point of view) and why you are applying to
                            study medicine. So write honestly and from the heart – no two applicants are the same,
                            you are unique so highlight this in your personal
                            statement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, this is much easier said than done. Writing a personal statement can’t be done
                            quickly because you need to take your time to really think about what you want to
                            include and sometimes you can end up feeling lost. But our Alumni are here to help
                            you. If you get in touch with one of our Alumni, they can read through your first draft
                            and offer you help and feedback on how to improve your personal statement so that the
                            best of you shines through to the Admissions
                            of the medical schools you are applying to.

                        <p>
                            Once you send off you application via UCAS, you will patiently await to hear back from
                            medical schools whether you’ve passed through to the interview stage. Different medical
                            schools have different formats for their interviews. The three main types of
                            interviews are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="font-weight-600">Traditional: </span> Traditional interviews are panel
                            interviews lasting 20-40 minutes in which you will meet with one or more interviewers
                            and be asked questions that allow them to assess
                            how suited you are to studying the medical course offered at that university. You will
                            be asked questions about why you wish to study medicine, what your interests and aims in
                            life are. You may be asked questions that will
                            require you to demonstrate your ability to think critically, scientifically or
                            mathematically or that test your understanding of medical ethics. It is important when
                            preparing for such interviews that you have some knowledge
                            about what’s currently happening in the medical field which you can learn about by
                            reading medical news online.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="font-weight-600">MMI: </span> Multiple Mini-Interviews consist of a number
                            of interview stations that each last around 10 minutes. At a station you may be faced
                            with an interviewer who may ask you a question
                            about you (similar to those outlined in the traditional interview section above). Or an
                            interviewer may present you with a dilemma/problem that you will need to find a solution
                            to or answer a question about. Or lastly you
                            may be faced with an actor with a specific scenario and you will have to demonstrate how
                            you would approach and deal with that scenario. These types of interviews may be very
                            different to traditional interviews so having
                            the chance to practice interviews with this format would be highly beneficial. You can
                            do this by connecting with one of our Alumni who will be able to offer you a mock
                            interview of MMI-style.

                            <span class="font-weight-600">Oxbridge </span>Oxbridge Interviews are panel interviews
                            but they are different from traditional interviews in terms of the type of questions
                            they ask. These interviews heavily focus on assessing
                            how you think and approach problems that are beyond your current scientific
                            knowledge/capabilities. You will often be asked a question that tests your mathematical
                            skills and also potentially a question relating to medical
                            ethics issues. During these interviews they tend to ask you questions which at face
                            value may seem like ones you don’t know how to answer. But what the interviewer will
                            want to see is you trying to approach the problem/question
                            based on the A-level knowledge you possess and ultimately they want you to discuss how
                            you’re thinking about it. Again, as with other interview formats, the best way to
                            prepare is to ensure you read around current topics
                            within the medical field and, more importantly to practice an Oxbridge-style interview.
                            You can do this by connecting with one of our Alumni at Oxbridge to arrange a mock
                            interview.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The interview stage is one of the most challenging parts of the application process.
                            Ultimately the best people to seek advice from about interviews are the people who have
                            gone through the process themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Visiting our Alumni page will allow you to connect with a current student at the
                            medical schools you’ve applied to. Once you find a Alumni, you can ask them for advice
                            and any questions you have about interviews at their university and many of our Alumni
                            will also be able to offer you ‘Mock Interviews’ that mimic the style of interview at
                            their medical school.

                            <span class="font-weight-600">Clearing: </span> If you were not able to secure a place
                            prior to taking your exams, you may be able to reapply during the UCAS Clearing period
                            after exams. Clearing is how medical schools
                            will fill in remaining spaces left on their course to interested students who have
                            obtained excellent grades.
                        </p>

                            <span class="font-weight-600">Fifth Option / Different Course: </span> With UCAS, you
                            can apply for a maximum of four medical schools and you also get given a fifth option in
                            which you apply for a non-medicine course. So
                            before sending off your application, select an appropriate fifth course that you may
                            want to study if you don’t secure a place on a medical course. This could be something
                            like a biomedical sciences course, a pre-med course,
                            physiology, human biology, anatomy, pharmacology, biochemistry. If you choose to study
                            one of these courses, it will prepare you well for applying for a postgraduate medicine
                            course afterwards. Some courses may also allow
                            you to transfer to a medical course after your first year on a different course – check
                            on medical school websites for which universities allow this:-

                            <span class="font-weight-600">Gap Year: </span>You may choose to take a gap year during
                            which time you could get some work experience in an area related to medicine or care in
                            general. Or you may even choose to do some
                            (medical) volunteering either in the UK or abroad – such opportunities can be found
                            online. This will help you to obtain some valuable experience that will make you a
                            highly competitive applicant if you re-Apply for Medicine
                            the following year.

                            to medical school in the following year, you may also consider resitting certain A-level
                            or IB exams to boost your grade to help
                            make you an even more competitive applicant. But do note that some universities do not
                            accept students applying with grades from exams they have re-sat.

                            postgraduate medical student and
                            seek advice from them about how they approached a similar situation that you may be
                            facing.
